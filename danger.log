        functionality
        scalability(1, 2 or all 4 cores of your VM are visible to the threads of your process)
            making the right number of cores are visible and exploring binding your process and thread(s) to specific cores: 
                'taskset' command (see the —cpu-list option): https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-taskset-command/
                'numactl' command: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/numactl.htm
            limit server to running on a certain number of cores
                `sudo apt-get install cgroup-tools`
                `man cgexec`

check:
    want server to run forever: cannot return -1 in main

question:
    xml換行縮排有差嗎
    query error format
    how many client, how to deal with this

    limit (save float, print int)
    price and balance is float
    condition check, ex. >0
    parallel: 有人要cancel, order先改成cancel就不怕另一個人買走
    cancel refund
    cancel twice no refund
    sell get money, buy get stock
    buy then sell: return price difference to buyer
    When cancel the order, verify that this transaction we are cancelling is created by the account_id
    add Row level locking for parallize
